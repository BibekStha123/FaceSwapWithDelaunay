# FaceSwapWithDelaunay
This repository consists of face swap code using dlib and opencv. Here we have 3 different python files, where  one file consist of finding the coordinate points of the landmark, the second consist of making a delaunay triangulation and voronoi diagram. And the last one includes the face swap code using the .txt file generated by the first python file.
